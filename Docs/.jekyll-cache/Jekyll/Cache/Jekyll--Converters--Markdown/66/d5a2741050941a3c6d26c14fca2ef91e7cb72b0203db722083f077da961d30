<p>We were given the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Write-Your-Own-Adventure-Microcomputer/dp/0686878329">Write Your Own Adventure: Programs for You Microcomputer</a> in order to reproduce the text adventure inside using the BASIC implementation. This took at least 3 hours to write and fix, copying line by line of code filled with one letter variables.</p>

<p>My biggest mistake was not reading the little information bubbles to the side of the code that helpfully gave you information on changing the code for the type of emulator youâ€™re using or explaining how the code works.</p>

<p>My second mistake was just my typing ability; there were many mis-spelled variables. Specifically, when I ran the game, I encountered an error where I could go East when there wasnâ€™t an exit East. I found out that I had just simply typed in the wrong letters where the room exits were defined, so East and West were muddled up.</p>

<p>After a bunch of small fixes, and some reformatting of print statements for my own benefit (and sanity), the text adventure worked.</p>

<p>My next task is to implement this game in C++ using Object Oriented Programming and other modern coding techniques.</p>
