I"D<p>My first step in developing the C++ port of Basic Reb0rn was to get my documentation sorted. I setup a basic GDD and TDD with information from the book and my plans for the game.
By reading the book indepth to find out about its design, I learned alot more about the game that I did by simply copying the BASIC code.</p>
